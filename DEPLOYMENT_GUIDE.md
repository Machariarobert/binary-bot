# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Fix Live Site Redirects

## 📌 Problem
The **live version** of your site is still redirecting from bot.html to the landing page, even though all redirect mechanisms have been removed from the source code.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The live site is serving **old compiled JavaScript** that still contains the redirect logic. Your source code changes are correct, but Vercel needs to **rebuild** the application with the updated source to generate new compiled files.

---

## ✅ Solution: Trigger Vercel Rebuild

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your `binary-bot` project

2. **Navigate to Deployments**
   - Click on "Deployments" tab
   - Find the latest deployment

3. **Redeploy**
   - Click the three dots (...) menu
   - Select "Redeploy"
   - Confirm the redeployment

4. **Wait for Build to Complete**
   - Monitor the build logs
   - Wait for "Build Complete" status (30-60 seconds)

5. **Test the Live Site**
   - Visit your production URL
   - Navigate to `bot.html`
   - Confirm no redirect occurs

---

### Option 2: Push Empty Commit (Alternative)

If you don't have access to Vercel dashboard, trigger a rebuild via Git:

```powershell
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger Vercel rebuild for redirect removal"
git push origin master
```

This will trigger Vercel's automatic deployment on push.

---

### Option 3: Vercel CLI Redeploy

If you have Vercel CLI installed:

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Trigger production deployment
vercel --prod
```

---

## 🎯 What the Rebuild Will Do

### Source Files Already Updated:
✅ `src/botPage/view/View.js` - Removed banner token checks (lines 843-890)
✅ `src/indexPage/index.js` - Disabled 7-day timer (lines 60-64)
✅ `src/common/utils/utility.js` - Disabled geographic redirects (lines 40-63)
✅ `src/common/lang.js` - Disabled language change redirect (lines 35-60)
✅ `src/indexPage/react-components/bot-landing/ModalComponent.jsx` - Disabled modal redirect
✅ `templates/partials/security.mustache` - Added redirect from / to bot.html
✅ `vercel.json` - Already configured with redirects

### Build Process Will:
1. Pull latest source from master branch
2. Run `npm run build-min` (as specified in vercel.json)
3. Compile TypeScript/ES6 → ES5
4. Bundle all modules with Webpack
5. Generate new `bot.min.js` (3.28 MB) and `index.min.js` (1.4 MB)
6. Include ALL redirect removal changes
7. Deploy to production CDN

## 📊 Expected Results After Deployment

### Before (Current Live Site):
❌ Bot.html redirects to landing page
❌ Banner token checks active
❌ 7-day timer active
❌ Geographic redirects active

### After (Rebuilt Site):
✅ Bot.html stays on bot page
✅ No banner token checks
✅ No time limits
✅ No geographic restrictions
✅ Root URL redirects to bot.html
✅ Permanent bot access

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After Vercel deployment completes, test these scenarios:

### Test 1: Direct Bot Access
```
Visit: https://your-domain.com/bot.html
Expected: Bot interface loads immediately
Expected: No redirect to landing page
```

### Test 2: Root URL Redirect
```
Visit: https://your-domain.com/
Expected: Automatically redirects to /bot.html
Expected: Bot interface visible
```

### Test 3: Index Redirect
```
Visit: https://your-domain.com/index.html
Expected: Automatically redirects to /bot.html
Expected: Bot interface visible
```

### Test 4: Clear Storage & Reload
```
Open DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear All
Reload: https://your-domain.com/bot.html
Expected: Bot still loads (no token required)
Expected: No redirect
```

### Test 5: Time Persistence
```
Stay on bot.html for 5+ minutes
Expected: No redirect after 2 minutes
Expected: No redirect after any time period
```

### Test 6: Language Change
```
Click language selector
Select different language
Expected: Page reloads with new language
Expected: Stays on bot.html (no redirect to landing)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Seeing Redirects After Deployment

**Possible Cause:** Browser cache

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try in Incognito/Private window
4. Check different browser

### Issue: Vercel Build Fails

**Check Build Logs:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on failed deployment
3. View "Building" logs
4. Look for errors

**Common Issues:**
- Node version mismatch → Check vercel.json has correct Node version
- Missing dependencies → Ensure package.json is up to date
- Sass compilation errors → Already fixed with Dart Sass migration

### Issue: Changes Not Reflected

**Verify Git Push:**
```powershell
git log --oneline -5
# Should show recent commits:
# - feat: make bot page the main landing page
# - feat: remove all redirect mechanisms
```

**Check Vercel Integration:**
1. Ensure Vercel is connected to your GitHub repo
2. Ensure auto-deploy on push is enabled
3. Check deployment tab shows recent deployment
